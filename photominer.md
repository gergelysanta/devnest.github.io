# PhotoMiner

## Rediscover Your Forgotten Photos

Have you ever tried to find a photo you received long ago — only to realize you don’t remember whether it came through Mail, Messenger, or some other app?

Each app stores images in its own way, often buried in hidden folders, with no simple way to browse or retrieve them. Add to that the chaos of external drives filled with thousands of oddly named files, sometimes all dumped into a single directory — and locating your memories becomes a challenge.

PhotoMiner is here to help.

## Scan Any Folder — Even Entire Drives

PhotoMiner is a lightweight macOS utility that scans any directory — internal or external — for photographs. Simply drag and drop a folder into the app window or its Dock icon, and it will begin searching for images automatically.

Photos are presented in chronological order, using EXIF metadata when available, or file creation dates as a fallback.

## Native Tools for Browsing and Management

With PhotoMiner, you can:

- Open images in your default viewer (e.g., Preview)
- Use Quick Look, just like in Finder
- Delete unwanted files
- Apply basic edits
- Reveal files directly in Finder

The interface is clean and intuitive, built to match the look and feel of macOS.

## Smart Grouping by Date

PhotoMiner automatically organizes your photos by month and year. Each group contains only the images taken during that period, making it easy to browse by memory or event.

This also simplifies cleaning up and organizing messy folders:
just select a group, and drag & drop the photos to any destination you like.

You can also drag thumbnails directly to an external editor or viewer — just drop them onto the Dock icon of your preferred app.

PhotoMiner was originally built to solve a personal frustration — now it’s available on the Mac App Store to help others regain control over their photo collections. While development on this version is no longer active, a new, more powerful successor is currently in development.
